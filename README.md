  Build a simple RESTful API using NodeJS and Express that allows users to manage a to-do list. The API should support basic CRUD operations and store data in memory/writing it to a json file.

Features to Implement
	1	Create Task
		◦	FE :
			⁃	Input fields for task title and due date.
			⁃	Button to add the task to the list.
		◦	BE :
			⁃	Endpoint: POST /todos.
			⁃	Response: Created to-do item with unique ID.
	2	Edit Task
    ◦	FE :
      ⁃	Ability to update the title and due date of an existing task.
    ◦	BE :
      ⁃	Endpoint: PUT /todos.
      ⁃	Response: update a to-do item.
	3	Delete Task
    ◦	FE :
      ⁃	Button to remove a task from the list.
    ◦	BE :
      ⁃	Endpoint: DELETE /todos/:id.
      ⁃	Response: Success message or deleted item.
	4	Task Completion
    ◦	FE :
      ⁃	Checkbox or toggle to mark a task as completed.
    ◦	BE :
      ⁃	Endpoint: PATCH /todos/:id/complete.
      ⁃	Response: Updated item with completed: true.
	5 Row Coloring Logic
    ◦	If the task is completed: light green background.
    ◦	If the task is overdue (due date < current date): light red background.
    ◦	If the task is due today: light yellow background.
    ◦	If the task is upcoming (due date > current date): default background.

Technical Requirements
	•	Use React.js with TypeScript.
	•	Node js, Express js.
	•	Use functional components and React hooks.
	•	Create a JSON file to store to-do items (no DB)
